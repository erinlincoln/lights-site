Here are my thoughts on JSON data sent from the frontend to the backend

data format changes for each mode, but all will have the basic format:

{
    "area": {
        "room": 
        "zone"
        "strip"
    },
    "mode": { 
        name: "<mode_name>" (string) (ignore),
        type: "<mode_type>"
    },
    "data": {
        (Mode-dependent data here)
    }
}

We can also add other non-mode-dependent data later (such as timestamp, etc) as needed

For specific modes:

{
    "mode": "Solid",                // Displays a solid color
    "data": {
        "color": "#XXXXXX"          // The color to display
    }
}

{
    "mode": "Gradient",             // Displays a gradient centered at a point, fading from one color to another
    "data": {
        "colors": [color1, color2],        // The color at the center of the gradient
        "center": float between 0 and 1,        // The color at the edge of the gradient
        "pos": "##",                // The position on the strip, as a percentage (?), the gradient is centered at
        "strength": "##"            // The "strength" of the gradient- how spread out it is, also as a percentage
    }
}

{
    "mode": "Rainbow",              // Displays a rainbow that changes over time
    "data": {
        "speed": "##" float between 0 and 1              // The speed of the rainbow changing (TODO figure out what values work here)
    }
}

{
    "mode": "Twinkle",                // Displays stars that flicker on and off
    "data": {
        "colors" : [color]
        "speed": "##"               // The speed of the rainbow changing (TODO figure out what values work here)
        "frequency": float between 0 and 1
    }
}

{
    "mode": "MeterColor",           // Changes each meter of the strand to a solid color
    "data": {
        [

        ]
    }
}
